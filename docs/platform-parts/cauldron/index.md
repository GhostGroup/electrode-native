A cauldron is a centralized document database that is used to store information about the client mobile application versions, native dependencies, and information about MiniApps. There is one cauldron per mobile application. With appropriate permissions, you can use the Electrode Native CLI commands to access and modify the data stored within the Cauldron. Some Electrode Native CLI commands are relying on the Cauldron for their execution.

A cauldron is not required to use Electrode Native. It is only required if you intend to use CodePush.

When using a cauldron, a container will automatically be regenerated, and its publishers/transformers pipeline executed, whenever running any cauldron command that alters the state _(the content)_ of a container associated to a cauldron descriptor. For example runnings commands such as `cauldron add miniapps` to add one or more miniapp to a container or `cauldron update miniapps` to update the version of some miniapps in a specific container, will cause a new container to be generated and potentially published

Please also note that if your cauldron is properly configured for container publication, you can also use the [cauldron regen-container] command to trigger a new generation and publication of a container for a given native application version, even if there are no changes to the content of the container (this can be useful in certain scenarios).
