While Git offers many benefits in our case compared to a large database system, developers who are familiar with Git repositories are also familiar with the Git workflow, which doesn't match the workflow when working with a cauldron repository. For example, developers working in a Git repository might be tempted to fork, branch, and issue pull requests for a cauldron, but should retain from doing so.

A Cauldron should only be updated using Electrode Native CLI commands. You should not update the Cauldron 'manually'. If you update a cauldron manually, you take the risk of bypassing all compatibility checks performed by Electrode Native and you de-synchronizing the container version and the yarn locks. Only exception to this rule is if you need to setup some `config` objects in the Cauldron _(container generator, manifest)_, as Electrode Native doest have any CLI command yet to write configuration to the Cauldron.
